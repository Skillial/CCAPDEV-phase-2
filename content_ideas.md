### Different salts
I've been wondering for a while now, what is the difference between kosher salt and iodized salt? Those tutorial vids always specify what types of salt to use, but I never understood why.
> Kosher's grain size is generally larger and "less salty" than other salts. It's generrally used more during cooking. Iodized, otherwise known as table salt, is the refined version with some additives. (https://www.bonappetit.com/story/what-is-kosher-salt)

### Advice needed
Hi! So I'm a 17 year old who has been cooking for 2-3 years already but do not have much experience in prep work as my parents usually do it for me. Late last year, I started taking charge of prepping when I cook and learned to chop more and more but I accidentally cut a chunk of my nail out which stopped me from chopping for a while. Recently, I have tried chopping again but my finger doesn't seem to trust me anymore. My brain tells me that I'll be fine and I just have to take it slow but my finger tells me that it will slip again and chop myself. Any advice on how to get over this? I really wanna go back to chopping again as it's quite fun.
> Look up some videos on YouTube on technique for how to hold the knife, where to rest it on your knuckle etc... and stick to it no matter how slow you are. With proper technique the risk of injury is extremely low. Let speed come naturally - donâ€™t try to force it. Also make sure your knives are sharp

>> Make sure you're using the right knife for the job. Too big or too small can work against you. I agree looking up some YouTube videos for improving your grip.
